<h1 style="text-align: center">Precious Themes</h1>

A family of themes for text editors, terminals and IDEs created using the
[Oklab](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/) perceptual color space.

---
#### Properties:

- The colors have approximately equal perceived lightness and contrast against the background.
- The foreground has the same contrast against the background as the colors.
- Colors of a precious theme can be automatically calculated in the Oklab color space from another precious theme,
  allowing the whole theme to be generated automatically and easing the process of implementing precious themes.
  _A tool to do so with configurations will be published soon._
